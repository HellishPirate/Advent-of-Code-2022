# Advent-of-Code-2022
I've deleted all the inputs from the website that I did not process and save as a .mat file; as such, the input must be downloaded directly from the website itself.
The code should also change to reflect however the input would be saved as (e.x., readlines("day8input.txt") would be changed to readlines("input.txt"), just depends on whatever you name it).
This is because the creator of AoC has requested that inputs are not to be committed to Github.
I'm too lazy to figure out how gitignore works.
Not sure what else to put in a readme, except hey hello
